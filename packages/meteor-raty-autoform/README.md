AutoForm input type for [Raty](https://github.com/wbotelhos/raty), a jQuery star rating form control.

Add `type=raty` in your AutoForm templates or in the schema. Bundled Raty images are used by default, but you can customize them and other options by adding a `ratyOptions` attribute to your inputs and binding a template helper of Raty options to it.
